# Udacity_Investigate_a_Dataset_No_show_Appointment_Project_v2
> **This dataset collects information
from 100 k medical appointments in
Brazil and is focused on the question
of whether or not patients show up
for their appointment. A number of
characteristics about the patient are
included in each row.**
* ‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.
* ‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital.
* ‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program [Bolsa Família](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolsa_Fam%C3%ADlia).
* Be careful about the encoding of the last column: it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.

### Question(s) for Analysis
>**What factors are
important for us to
know in order to
predict if a patient will
show up for their
scheduled
appointment?**
