# Investigate_a_Dataset-No_show_Appointment-_v2
This dataset collects informationfrom 100k medical appointments inBrazil and is focused on the questionof whether or not patients show upfor their appointment. A number ofcharacteristics about the patient areincluded in each row.● ‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment. ● ‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital. ● ‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família. ● Be careful about the encoding of the last column: it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.
